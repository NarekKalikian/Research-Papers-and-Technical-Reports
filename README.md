<h2>Disability-Friendly Biometric Systems Research Paper</h2>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
In this paper, I discuss the pre-existing concerns of accessibility and inclusivity related to biometrics. Accessibility problems and disability bias breed biometric technologies that are not user-friendly for all consumers. This paper also proposes design changes that can be implemented to increase the overall inclusivity and accessibility of these systems, such as allowing users to choose from multiple biometric methods within one system. The paper also examines specific disabilities and the appropriate systems to address users with these disabilities. An example of one such disability is blindness and its effect on the accuracy and execution of iris and retina scans. By adding other ways of getting past the authentication process, such as scanning the sclera instead, we are putting a more accessible and inclusive system in place. Additionally, this paper highlights case studies with real-world examples. We aim to bring attention to human and machine bias towards impaired individuals and suggest possible solutions to increase inclusivity within the field of biometrics.

<h2>Circuits II (EE221) Lab Reports</h2>

<h3>Section Overview</h3>
<p>
The lab reports in this section pertain to the principles of electrical/electronic system design with relatively introductory complexity. Various circuit design, simulation, and implementation techniques and tools/software are presented. Lab work consisted of operating electrical circuit analysis tools such as multimeters, oscilloscopes, and function generators for circuits implemented on breadboards. Software such as LTSpice and MultiSim was used for pre-lab simulation purposes. Practicing soldering electrical parts onto the PCB as well.
